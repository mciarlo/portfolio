          <h2>About me</h2>
          <div class="column left">
            <p>I love designing and building products. When I&rsquo;m finally able to elegantly solve a problem, there&rsquo;s nothing better. I see my work as an extension of myself, and so each day is an opportunity to learn something new, to challenge myself, and to try and show someone else what I&rsquo;ve learned.<p>

            <p>When I'm not working, you can probably find me up past midnight toiling away on a side project for one of the many causes that are near and dear to my heart. My most recent side project was <a href="http://www.nowaynsa.com">NoWayNSA.com</a>. Civil and social rights are pretty big on my list of favorite things.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="column right">
            <p>It was designed and built in a few days so it&rsquo;s got some rough edges, but I truly believe in the power of the web. Even if I&rsquo;m only able to inform one person, it was worth it. The Web is a wonderful place.</p>

            <p>Outside the tech world, I&rsquo;m into weightlifting, skiing, and photography. Waking up in the morning to try and break a personal record is one of my favorite things. It&rsquo;s also fun to teach, so I&rsquo;m always inviting others to join. For more thoughts (and the occasional rant), you can find me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mciarlo" title="Follow me on Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/mciarlo" title="Follow me on Instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
