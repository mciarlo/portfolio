        <p class="project-description">Doo is an app I conceptualized, designed, and built as a team of one. I created it in response to the frustration I felt trying to find a simple, elegant to-do app. Popular solutions were either too complicated or too underwhelming. Doo has a deliberate, streamlined feature set rooted in psychology and stress reduction. This means that instead of replicating a pencil and paper, Doo helps you set achievable goals, and gives you the means to become a more disciplined you.</p>

        <p>A reminder includes a few primary attributes including the title, due date, and notes. I limited the number of items per card to ensure the interface didn’t get too busy. Information like the repeat duration or snooze count don’t provide enough value when vetting tasks.</p>

        <p>I originally wanted the cards to be typography driven, but they ended up feeling sterile. I added an illustration to give each card warmth. The complete and snooze buttons brought improved discoverability and accessibility support. I positioned the buttons inside the card so I could highlight each one during gestures and with greater clarity.</p>

        <blockquote>The challenge with cards was to create a sense of urgency for overdue tasks and to preserve negative space.</blockquote>

        <p>The challenge with cards was to create a sense of urgency for overdue tasks and to preserve negative space. Doo launched with the date bounded by the image because it’s the most important piece of information. The color turns from yellow to red depending on lateness. And the content appears beneath the image so there’s always plenty of white space.</p>

        <p>The main card view went through a few iterations. I explored the possibility of allowing cards to expand when tapped. I especially wanted to accomodate long lists. However when I prototyped this experience I quickly realized it was an anti-pattern. I didn’t want to encourage people to dump a long list of things into the notes section, or to write to-dos that were a paragraph long. Doo had be opinonated for the success of my users.</p>

        <img class="lazy-load invisible" src="../images/placeholder.png" data-src="../images/process_stack_03.jpg" data-src-retina="../images/process_stack_03@2x.jpg" alt="Stack evolution"/>

          <img class="" src="../images/process_stack_03@2x.jpg" alt="Stack evolution"/>
        </noscript>

        <p>Doo presents each card in a stack, forcing your attention onto only one task at a time. You can’t randomly access your to-dos like you would with a scrolling list. This way users have to acknowledge each task and make a choice whether to act or snooze.</p>

        <h4>Choosing an MVP</h4>

        <p>I launched the first version of Doo with a limited scope so I could iterate with a real user-base. The goal was to launch a product that would suit 90% of people. This meant Doo had to be great at creating repeating tasks, prioritization, and completion/snooze. Everything else was a distraction.</p>

        <p>As you might expect, a few months after launch the feature requests began to pile up. I saw new features as the perfect opportunity for a design realignment that woud lay the foundation for future additions like attachments. The update repurposed the illustrations to improve the available space for the title and notes. It also allowed the buttons to receed, further emphasizing the task. The attachments button fits naturally in the top corner, out of the way until needed.</p>

        <p>The edit screen was the most difficult view to get right. The goal was to enable users to understand the scope of a reminder just by looking at the initial view and without showing everything at once. Early concepts and prototypes were more waterfall in nature and didn’t do enough to provide varying levels of heirarchy. Further iterations moved the save and cancel buttons to the bottom of the card to improve one-handed use and push up the primary inputs. This proved problematic with the keyboard.</p>

        <p>I experimented with tabs and other means of creating structure. In one iteration I put date selection behind a calendar icon and a toggle. The calendar icon was too disconnected from the date itself.  Disclosure arrows that hinted at navigation competed with clear buttons. Attempts to solve each of these problems simultaneously often resulted in a dead end.</p>

        <p>The solution was to step back and evaluate the edit card in the context of a larger navigation pattern. I wanted each view to be a card that slide up from the bottom instead of the usual full-screen slide from the right.</p>

        <p>In order to make this work, I needed each screen to have a title, a primary action, and a dismiss button. The edit screen couldn’t hold the actions within the card. I used the navigation title and text button paradigm from the iOS Human Interface Guidelines while making the content area within each content area independent and card-like.</p>

        <img class="lazy-load invisible" src="../images/placeholder.png" data-src="../images/creation_process_03.jpg" data-src-retina="../images/creation_process_03@2x.jpg" alt="Stack evolution"/>

          <img class="" src="../images/creation_process_03@2x.jpg" alt="Stack evolution"/>
        </noscript>

        <p>The resulting navigation pattern provided enough flexibility to use across the edit screen, repeat options, date picker, and all other views, including Settings. I could draw each view as a card that would stack on top of each other. And I accomplished my goal of one-handed use by making each card dismissable with a downward swipe, which I tested using TestFlight. The result was positive. The gesture-based nature of Doo lent itself well across all screens. The text buttons provided the necessary discoverability until users discovered the gesture.</p>

        <h3 class="small-uppercase">Taking convention further</h3>
        <p>The navigation pattern in Doo builds on the iOS Human Interface Guidelines to reinforce the card metaphor. Each view’s hierarchy preserves the placement of common actions while allowing the content to come forward. And cards enter and exit with momentum and spring. The result is a familiar, more delightful experience.</p>

        <p>I created a few variations of the list early on but quickly zeroed in on a layout. The navigation pattern dictated that the background color be visible so that transitions occured from purple to purple. Going white to purple would hurt the card illusion. I also didn’t want to introduce views that felt out of place.</p>

        <p>I designed each row as a miniature card to create a visual relatonship between reminders across different screens. It had the added effect of making it more clear how many tasks appeared within the list. It also mapped more closely to the drag and drop experience, which manipulated single rows only.</p>

        <p>The final edit experience includes the standard iOS delete icon but deviates from the swipe paradigm. Revealing the standard delete disclosure made the interface feel disjointed. I also wanted to reveal up to five different options per row. I opted for a flexible menu button that could toggle a dialog from the bottom of the screen with any number of actions.</p>

        <h2>Design is in my veins</h2>
        <p>I’ve spent my career designing and launching ambitious products. My abilities in design and engineering mean I can work collaboratively accross teams. I excel at dissecting problems and zeroing in on solutions. Doo is my latest project, earning two Apple features in its first month. There are more walkthroughs coming &mdash; they just take a while! In the meantime, feel free to browse my Dribbble for more projects and experiments.</p>
